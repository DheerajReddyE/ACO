# 🐜 Optimized Network Routing using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) with Visualization

This project implements **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** to solve dynamic network routing problems. Inspired by the foraging behavior of ants, the algorithm finds optimal paths through a network by simulating pheromone deposition and evaporation. A graphical interface provides interactive visualization of the routing process.

## 📈 How It Works

1. The user defines the number of nodes and network structure.
2. Ants simulate traversal through the network based on pheromone levels and heuristic information (e.g., distance).
3. Paths are evaluated and pheromones are updated on edges of efficient routes.
4. Visualization reflects current best paths and pheromone strength on each edge.
5. Iterative process continues until convergence to an optimal/near-optimal path.
